When working with sensitive government information, you need to know that your data
is safe. The digital dashboard guarantees industry standards of data security allowing you
to upload and use sensitive data, knowing that it is as secure as possible.


### Data storage

All data is stored on a fully encrypted PostgreSQL database, hosted by Heroku. Click
[here](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security) to view Heroku's security and privacy
policy.

The only way to access this data is through the dashboard website. It cannot be accessed
by anyone who does not have a dashboard login.


### Passwords

All passwords are encrypted using Argon 2 (selected as the winner of the Password
Hashing Competition in 2015).

All users are initially assigned a randomly generated password that is emailed to them.
When they first log in, they are directed to create a new password which will only
be accepted if it's deemed to be 'strong' by [ZXCVBN](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)


### Isolating data within a dashboard

Each dashboard user can only see data that the dashboard admin as specifically allowed
to interact with see ([dashboard roles](dashboard-roles)). This data isolation is achieved
by three systems:

1. The dashboard interface will only display the pages from the dashboard that are relevant to them.
There is no way for a user to request a page for a project that they are not part of.

2. The backend code will not accept a request from a user who is not part of the project they are
requesting. This means that even if a user finds a way of bypassing the dashboard interface, they cannot
request or change any data on the backend unless the dashboard admin has allowed them to access that data.

3. Every request for data must be accompanied by a unique key that is stored securely on the heroku server.
The dashboard interface automatically provides that key for pages that a user is allowed to view. Otherwise
it is impossible for a user to interact with the backend data.


### Isolating data across multiple dashboards

The protections are in place where multiple dashboards are hosted on the same site, sharing
the same database (see [hosting](hosting)).

Data from one dashboard cannot 'leak' to another dashboard - each dashboard is effectively
independent of any others.
