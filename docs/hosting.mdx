## Hosting

:::tip

Wherever you choose to host your dashboard, you can link it to any site you want. For example
you could choose to have it as a subdomain of the main government site like
www.dashboards.gov.sl

:::

There are two options of how to host your dashboard

### Hosted on instute.global

The dashboard can be hosted on TBI's website - the address is
[dashboards.institute.global](https://digital-dashboards.herokuapp.com)

All dashboards hosted on institute.global share the same database, but the data is still secure
(see [data security](data-security))

This option is free as it does not involve any additional hosting costs.


### Hosted on a custom domain

Alternatively, the dashboard can be hosted on a separate domain with its own database. This
will incur a fee, the amount of which will depend on the expected traffic the site will receive.

If you would like to host on a separate domain, please include the information about number
of expected users when [requesting a dashboard](requesting-dashboard)


### Locally hosted dashboards

Currently we do not offer the option of hosting the dashboard on local government servers
