### Planning your custom milestones


:::tip

The dashboard uses the language of 'milestones' and 'actions.

A custom milestone is
usually considered to be a target that cannot be represented quantitively.
e.g. Delivery of key training event on 31 January

An action is a smaller piece of work that is assigned to one person. e.g. Submit
summary report based on this month's statistics.

This form is only for milestones, you can add specific actions once the dashboard
has been launched
