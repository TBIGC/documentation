### Action Tracker Only

The action tracker only dashboard is focussed on tasks - who is responsible and when it is due.
It is used for non-project tracking where budgets / targets / key performance indicators are not
needed.

For example, a government department may have an internal action tracker to monitor tasks within
various teams in that department, but not specific to any projects.

### Full project dashboard

The full project dashboard is for tracking specific projects that may involve inter-departmental colloboration.
The full dashboard has access to all the tools including budget / target / milestone / key performance
indicator tracking. It has various roles to allow different users to access the parts of the dashboard that
they are involved with (see [dashboard roles](dashboard-roles))
