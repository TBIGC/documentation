The TBI Project Dashboard software started in 2017 as a collaboration between the _Tony Blair
Institute for Global Change_ and the _Department for Science, Technology and Innovation_
Sierra Leone.

As the project grew, other departments within the Government of Sierra Leone began expressing
interest in this new project management tool, and additional features were added to meet
the requirements of the new clients.

Over time, other governments that TBI work with began to enquire about the dashboard, and
prototypes were rolled out to <b>Kenya, Nigeria, The Gambia and Democratic Republic of Congo</b>.

The software continued to develop and improve based on feedback from all users of the dashboard.

In February 2021, the TBI Project Dashboard was officially launched throughout the TBI network, and
we look forward to working with new clients to further improve the dashboards.
